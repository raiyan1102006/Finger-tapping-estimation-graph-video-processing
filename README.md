# Remote Diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease from Finger-tapping Videos: A Graph Signal Processing Approach

This repository holds sample data files and the analysis code for the named project. The detailed report and presentation slides that explain the algorithm can be found in this repository as well. The codes were developed by Raiyan Abdul Baten.

## What's in this Repository
The 'data' folder contains 4 sample videos of finger tapping. The 'analysis.m' file loads one of the videos at a time, and extracts finger-tapping frequency from it. At the beginning of the script, the video file to load can be specified.

## Installation and Usage

Please install the MATLAB package 'Image Processing Toolbox'.

The 'analysis.m' script can then be run from the MATLAB interface.
